        <p class="paragraph-4"> My Meeting with the aspiring owner of Adengappa 007 Salon - By Ranjith.<br>       <br>Being a part of the marketing and operations team of BookMyHairStylist, I usually visit new salons (for on boarding) as well as existing salons to improve their performance within our platform.As usual, we started our day by going to the market in order to on board new salons to our platform. A short brief about BookMyHairStylist here :) We on board salons as our platform helps them to manage their booking &amp; improve their online presence. We found an interesting salon by name &quot;ADENGAPPA SALON 007&quot; Men&#x27;s Grooming run by Mr. Ganesh Prabhu.<br> <br>We felt something intriguing about that salon from the moment we saw its name (English translation of the salon name: ,&quot;Wow Salon 007&quot;). We decided to step inside the salon &amp; have a conversation with the owner of the salon. This salon is located in Sundarapuram, Pollachi Road, Coimbatore (Insert BookMyHairStylist Salon Listing of that salon here)The design of the name board looked attractive and the wordings on the name board were too funny which might by itself grab the attention of the customers to visit the salon.<br> <br>A few examples are as follows: &quot;பசிச்சா சாப்பிடுங்க, முடி வளர்ந்தா கூப்பிடுங்க &quot; (Write the English translation here) &quot;வாடிக்கையாளர் துணை&quot;(Write the English translation here).Once we stepped inside the salon, you will not believe we hear the Tamil cultural instrumental songs that were played by the shop owner. He also has a high-quality DJ system with Television. He keeps on interacting with customers to avoid the waiting time and entertain the customer by playing the drums sound in the shop, even the customers enjoy the things which the shop owner do and they do not get tensed even if they wait for a long time and they enjoy the time when they are in the salon.<br> <br>I admire the ideas and way of approach from salon owner, we feel it might increase the customers and the business. From my point of view, in the high-class salon, the ambient looks good, experienced stylist, brand name, high pricing, waiting time will be more and more will there but in this salon, it was an attractive one, reasonable cost and customers enjoy the waiting time and everyone visit repeatedly.<br>           <br> Most Useful things in BookMyHairStylist is,<strong>                                                       <br> &#x27;A Satisfied the Customer Is the Best Business Strategy of all&quot;</strong>                                                                                                                                                  - <strong>Mitchell</strong>.<a href="https://tbt-corp.webflow.io/blog-1"><br></a></p>
